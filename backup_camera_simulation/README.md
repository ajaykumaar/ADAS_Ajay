Running the backup_cam_sim.py code will:
  1) Take the 'video1_final.mp4' file as input
  2) Calculate the trajectory of the rear wheels using the steering angles measured throughout the       frames with a compass and other assumptions for the BMW x1 model
  3) Plots and overlays the lines on the frames and saves the output as a video named     
     'video1_overlay_final.mp4'
